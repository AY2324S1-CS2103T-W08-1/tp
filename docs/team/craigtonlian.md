# Project: Staff-Snap

> ***Craigton Lian's*** *Project Portfolio Page*<br>

## Overview
Staff-Snap is a desktop HR management application used for managing employees. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about <span style="color:red">**[TO BE UPDATED]**</span> 10 kLoC.

## Summary of Contributions
* **New Feature**: Added the ability to undo/redo previous commands.
  * What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
  * Credits: *{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}*

* **New Feature**: Added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.
