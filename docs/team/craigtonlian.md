* **Interview Management Features**: Added the `addi`, `editi`, and `deletei` command.
  * **What it does**: Allows the user to add, edit, and delete interviews for each applicant.
  * **Justification**: This feature forms the core functionality of Staff-Snap, as it allows the user to manage the interview process for each applicant, while updating the interview rating progressively.
  * **Highlights**: This enhancement had to be carefully designed to ensure that the interview data is stored in a way that is easily accessible and modifiable by the user. Input validation and duplicate handling was also implemented to ensure that the data is consistent and accurate.
  * **Credits**: Automatic duplicate handling under the `addi` function was **not** implemented by me. This was implemented by my teammate [Austin Huang](https://ay2324s1-cs2103t-w08-1.github.io/tp/team/austinhuang1203.html).

* **Import CSV Feature**: Added the `import` command.
  * **What it does**: Allows the user to import a correctly-formatted CSV file containing applicant data into Staff-Snap.
  * **Justification**: This feature allows the users to directly import large amounts of applicant data into Staff-Snap using a common file format like CSV instead of manually keying in the data.
  * **Highlights**: This enhancement required careful and thorough error handling and input validation in order to prevent erroneous data from being added into Staff-Snap. 
  * **Credits**: The third-party library [OpenCSV](https://opencsv.sourceforge.net/) was used to parse the input CSV in the implementation of this feature.
