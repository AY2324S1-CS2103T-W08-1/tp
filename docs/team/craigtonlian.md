# Project: Staff-Snap

> ***Craigton Lian's*** *Project Portfolio Page*<br>

## Overview
Staff-Snap is a desktop hiring management application used for managing applicants during the recruitment cycle. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 9k LoC.

## Summary of Contributions
* **Interview Management Features**: Added the ability to create new interviews to each applicant.
  * What it does: Allows the user to add, edit, and delete interviews for each applicant.
  * Justification: This feature forms the core functionality of Staff-Snap, as it allows the user to manage the interview process for each applicant, while updating the interview rating progressively.
  * Highlights: This enhancement had to be carefully designed to ensure that the interview data is stored in a way that is easily accessible and modifiable by the user. Input validation and duplicate handling was also implemented to ensure that the data is consistent and accurate.
  * Automatic duplicate handling under the `addi` function was **not** implemented by me. This was implemented by my teammate [Austin Huang](https://ay2324s1-cs2103t-w08-1.github.io/tp/team/austinhuang1203.html).

* **Import CSV Feature**: Added the ability to import a CSV file into Staff-Snap.
  * What it does: allows the user to import a correctly-formatted CSV file containing applicant data into Staff-Snap.
  * Justification: This feature allows the users to directly import large amounts of applicant data into Staff-Snap using a common file format like CSV instead of manually keying in the data.
  * Highlights: This enhancement required careful and thorough error handling and input validation in order to prevent erroneous data from being added into Staff-Snap. 
  * Credits: The third-party library [OpenCSV](https://opencsv.sourceforge.net/) was used to parse the input CSV in the implementation of this feature.
