Project: Staffsnap

Staffsnap - An app for HR people.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

● **New Feature**: (ﬁller content) Added the ability to undo/redo previous

commands.

○ What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands

one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by

using the redo command.

○ Justiﬁcation: This feature improves the product signiﬁcantly

because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app

should provide a convenient way to rectify them.

○ Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and

commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth

analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was

challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

○ Credits: *{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from*

*elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature*

*so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how*

*much effort went into the feature}*
