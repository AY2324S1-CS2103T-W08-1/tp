## Introduction

Welcome to the **Staff-Snap** User Guide!

**Staff-Snap** is a desktop app for Hiring Managers like you to manage the hiring and tracking of applicants, 
optimised for use via a [Command Line Interface (CLI)](#glossary). Used by hiring managers in companies around the globe, 
it is effective, easy-to-use and reliable, making the hiring process a much more enjoyable experience.

The purpose of this guide is to get you familiar with the features of **Staff-Snap** - from the very basics, 
to the most advanced features the application has to offer. 
These features range from the simple task of adding an applicant to being able to calculate an applicant's score from their ratings in the interview stages. 
Every single feature is explained in this guide. You can check out the [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents) to navigate to a feature you might be interested in using.

Once this is done, go to the [Quick Start](#quick-start) section to get the app up and running. Once you have done so, please feel free to go through the features sections to find out what features Staff-Snap has installed.

<a name="addi"></a>
#### Adding an interview to an applicant: `addi`

Adds a new interview to an applicant. In the case of duplicate names, the system will automatically increment the last 
number in the user input until it hits a unique input, or add 1 if there is no number. However, if the input is too
large, or there are too many duplicates, the system might throw a message asking you to handle it manually without 
handling it for you.

Note: The name change is permanant so removing previous interviews will not change back the name. That is if both
`technical1` and `technical2` exist, deleting `technical1` will not change `technical2` back to `technical1`.

Duplicate handling: 
* Entering `technical12`, then `technical12` again will result in the 2nd entry being converted to 
`technical13`.
* Entering `technical`, `technical1`, then `technical` again will result in the 2nd `technical` entry being 
converted to `technical2`.
* Entering `technical`, then `technical` again will result in the 2nd entry being converted to `technical1`.

Format: `addi INDEX t/TYPE [r/RATING]`
* Adds an interview to the applicant at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed applicant list.
* A maximum of 5 interviews can be added to each applicant.

Example:
* `addi 1 t/technical r/8.6` adds a Technical interview with rating 8.6 to the 1st person in the displayed applicant list.
* `addi 3 t/screening` adds a Screening interview without rating to the 3rd person in the displayed applicant list.

<box type="warning" header="**Caution**">
    Rating will be rounded to the nearest 1 decimal place if more than 1 decimal place is provided.
